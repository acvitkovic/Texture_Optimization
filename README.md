# Texture_Optimization
A program written in java that takes a 3D model as input and its respected textures. The user then may check options about the viewport distance and environments the object will be set in, to downscale the texture while maintaining high fidelity and texture integrity. Also used to create non-dynamic LODs to keep the RAM usage of videogames low.

Written as a final bachelor's degree project, for the subject "Software Engineering".
